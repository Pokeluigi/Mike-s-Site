<h2>This tab is where we get a little bit serious and start talking about LGBT+ history and current struggles</h2>
<p>First we have the origins of the LGBT movement starting with the homophile movement in the 50's and moving to the Gay liberation movement of the 60's and 70's our gay anscestors paved the way for us to live our lives openly and without fear of persecution and though the work is not yet finished we would not be nearly where we are right now without the work they did I can tell you that for free.</p><br>
<p>In modern times there is still a lot of anti-LGBT rhetoric in particular Trans issues have made headlines and often not for good reasons the trans community has been thoroughly demonised and treated like predators until proven innocent in the case of transwomen and all but ignored or treated as traitors in the case of trans-men <br>The movement of TERFs (Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists) as well as SWERFs (Sex-Work Exclusionary radical feminists) and the level to which they have worked to hold sway on certain policy decisions has been felt by the LGBT community and in particular the trans members of the community. </p>
