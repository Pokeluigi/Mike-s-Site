<p>Drag is old hun old as balls ;D and I love it it's so much fun from the wigs to the costumes to the whole affair it brings me so much joy to do and to watch I used to do drag semi-regularly but at some point decided it wasn't quite my calling in life in spite of the amount of fun I was having I sucked at makeup like was so so bad the skin was fine but the eye was always TERRIBLE like just so bad and I wasn't getting any better so... I quit that said I'm putting together a look or two here just for fun and for old times sake :)</p>
