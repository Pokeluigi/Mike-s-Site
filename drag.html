<p>Drag is old hun old as balls ;D and I love it it's so much fun from the wigs to the costumes to the whole affair it brings me so much joy to do and to watch I used to do drag semi-regularly but at some point decided it wasn't quite my calling in life in spite of the amount of fun I was having I sucked at makeup like was so so bad the skin was fine but the eye was always TERRIBLE like just so bad and I wasn't getting any better so... I quit that said I still enjoy the artform very much and Now that lockdowns are loosening I'm very excited to be going out and seeing Drag performers once again out in the wild oooh it's like a safari.</p>
