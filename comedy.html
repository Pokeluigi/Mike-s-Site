<p>So Comedy bet you didn't know I did stand up did you sweaty well MIMI we did or I did anyways. <br>
    This is just a snippet of my stand-up set just for you sweetheart doesn't that just make you special and warm and fuzzy inside.</p>
<p>Hello My name is Michael Burton. <br>Now I see some new faces in the audience tonight?
New Lips
New Cheeks
And a couple of old arseholes
But enough about me
well actually let me introduce myself properly my name is Michael Burton I am 22 years young and I love to travel. You know and when I do travel I like to get gifts for people.
I went to spain and I got my Father some cervesa.
I went to France and I brought my Mother some Champagne from Lidl.
And when I went to New York I gave my boyfriend Syphillis.
Before all this I used to work in clubs in the words of Tina Turner I was a Nutbush but enough about the Syphillis.
When I was working in the clubs I would so often be accosted by this specific young woman whenever a certain song would come on
She would somehow always find me on the dance floor grab me by the arm and yell 'I know you' and force me to dance with her
I was in the McDonalds down the street from the club the song came on the radio 'I know you' and she appears from the cleaning cupboard still drunk and forces me to dance
I was back home in manchester on the toilet the song comes on shuffle on spotify *knock knock knock* I know you
But I haven't seen at all recently the song isn't popular anymore I can't help but wonder where she is now? she could be still out there partying, she could be married to a different emotionally stunted gay man or maybe just maybe she's finally dead.
